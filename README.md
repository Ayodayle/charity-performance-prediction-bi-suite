# Charity Performance Prediction BI Suite

This project is a toolkit for helping non-profits and public sector organisations build predictive models to forecast and monitor key performance outcomes; such as employment success, housing stability, or program engagement.

By using simulated data, Python, and Power BI, the project demonstrates how organisations can proactively track outcome metrics and make data-informed decisions with minimal technical overhead.
